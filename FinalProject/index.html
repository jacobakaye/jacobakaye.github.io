        <p>Crime is a significant concern for individuals and society as a whole. It impacts personal safety, economic prosperity, and social well-being. Understanding the patterns and trends of crime can provide valuable insights for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and communities to develop strategies for crime prevention and reduction. Crime statistics provide an overview of the frequency of criminal activities in a particular region or country. Tracking these numbers over a period of time can help identify patterns and trends in crime rates, which can then be used to develop strategies to address them. In this article, I will analyze the crime trends in the United States from 2000 to 2020 based on the data on property crime, burglary, violent crime, motor vehicle theft, robbery, aggravated assault, larceny, and the total number of crimes.</p>

        <p>The data used in this analysis comes from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The UCR collects data on crimes reported to law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. The data includes information on violent crimes, such as murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, as well as property crimes, such as burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.</p>

        <p>The data indicates that there has been a downward trend in crime in the United States over the past two decades. The total number of crimes decreased from 46.22 million in 2000 to 30.76 million in 2020, a reduction of about 33%. However, the trends for specific types of crimes have been different.</p>

        <p>The data reveals a gradual decrease in the total number of crimes committed per year, with the total number of crimes dropping from 46.2 million in 2000 to 30.8 million in 2020. This represents a decrease of over 33% in the total number of crimes committed over two decades.</p>

        <p>The data also shows a clear trend toward decreasing rates of property crimes, with the sum of property crimes dropping from over 20.3 million in 2000 to just over 12.9 million in 2020. This represents a decrease of nearly 36% in 20 years. </p>

        <p>Similarly, the sum of motor vehicle thefts decreased by 30% from 2.32 million in 2000 to 1.62 million in 2020. The rate of motor vehicle thefts showed a steep decline in the early 2000s, followed by a plateau in the mid-2010s, and then a slight increase towards the end of the decade.</p>

        <p>The trend in violent crimes shows a fluctuation in rates over the two decades, with a peak in 2006 and 2007, followed by a gradual decline. The sum of violent crimes decreased from 2.85 million in 2000 to 2.63 million in 2020, a decrease of 8%. However, this trend hides the increase in violent crimes between 2014 and 2016. Robbery also decreased by 40% from 816,032 in 2000 to 487,200 in 2020.</p>

<div>
  <p>I asked Angela Ferrara, an ex-NYPD and Suffolk County police officer, about why crimes have generally decreased throughout the United States between 2000-2020.</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="mb-0">“In 2001, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by terrorists. This throughout the nation set forth a “ new” path of heightened awareness. Obviously not only from a foreign land but on our Nation's land in its entirety. “See Something, Say Something”. The public has become much more “aware” of their surroundings, especially for personal reasons. Law enforcement has also played a large role as “Community Relations” have increased. Police officers are part of the community which makes it easier for the public to interact with Law enforcement which helps keep crime statistics down. Law enforcement training has increased- also setting a new pattern for interacting with the public. Prior to 2000 training for officers was basically crime-related and emergency standards. Since 2000, training has been increased to interracial, ethnic, sexual, religious, and gender interactions including crime prevention. This again creates a good environment for Law Enforcement and the community to work together to keep crime Statistics down.”</p>

      <p>I decided to dive a bit deeper into this analysis by looking at the four most populated states to see if these trends align. According to the US Census, the four most populated states in the US are California, Florida, New York, and Texas.</p>

      <p>Some of my initial observations from the dataset are as follows:
        <ul>
  <li>The population of these four states increased over the 20-year period.</li>
  <li>There is variation in the crime rates across the states and over time.</li>
  <li>California consistently has the highest crime rates across all categories.</li>
  <li>Property crime is more common than violent crime across all states.</li>
  <li>Robbery and aggravated assault are the most common violent crimes.</li>
</ul></p>

      <p>As said before, California consistently had the highest number of reported violent crimes among the four states throughout the 21-year period. In 2020, California reported 174,026 violent crimes, which is more than 1.32 times the number of violent crimes reported in Texas, the state with the second-highest number of violent crimes. But, California did have the highest population throughout this time period. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, analyzing crime data from 2000 to 2020 provides valuable insights into crime rates in the United States. While there were some decreases in violent crime rates over time, property crime rates remained high in many states. By examining these trends on a state-by-state basis, officials can work to address specific issues and make their communities safer.</p>
